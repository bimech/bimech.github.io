Happy Monday!! Hope you all had an amazing weekend.

Here is a quick update about some of the improvements we made to [DomReactor](https://domreactor.com) this past week. Also, here are some interesting articles to get your week started. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.  


#### **What we are reading this week**

**[Here’s Why Founders Should Care about Happiness](http://firstround.com/review/Heres-Why-Founders-Should-Care-about-Happiness?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(12 min read)</span>  
"There’s a common assumption, that you will be happy when you are successful. But the reverse is actually true, and not just anecdotally. Hard neurological science supports the idea that happy people have more capacity to succeed. And beyond that, that happiness is not a genetic mandate, or a product of circumstance. It’s a choice." - Scott Crabtree

**[How to Create Company Values That Mean Something](http://wistia.com/blog/company-values?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(8 min read)</span>  
You have to look beyond the superficial labels and words that comprise your values and into the purpose and history behind them. That's the only way we've been able to resolve seemingly intractable conflicts.

**[Always Improve, Never Stop, Never Pause, Never Appreciate](http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/28/always-improve-never-appreciate.html?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
Taking a moment and a step back to reflect and appreciate what you’ve already achieved can be a much more powerful and energizing experience than always looking for more things to improve.

**[Using imagemagick, awk and kmeans to find dominant colors in images](http://javier.io/blog/en/2015/09/30/using-imagemagick-and-kmeans-to-find-dominant-colors-in-images.html?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(2 min read)</span>  
A neat little article about how you can find dominant colors within images. This is something that we deeply care about. We might end up using this for generating the colors of the bounding boxes on the screenshot comparison tool.

**[How to scale your company culture ](https://medium.com/@keen_io/how-to-scale-your-company-culture-4535027dc603?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(7 min read)</span>  
What do these values actually mean, though? If I’m a new employee coming into an organization, am I expected to know how to convey these values? No. Of course not. That’s why companies instill their cultural values in all kinds of different ways. For example, at Facebook the value “moving fast and breaking things” is introduced during onboarding. But instead of just telling people to “move fast and break things,” Facebook sends all new employees off for 6 weeks to literally code new things, break things, and learn from seasoned “fast movers and breakers”.  

**[Not Wanted](https://medium.com/@natekontny/not-wanted-fc6db3f263d5?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(2 min read)</span>  
Instead of focusing on trying to sell more stuff to people who have plenty of that stuff, I focused on the people who don’t yet have these tools or experiences.

**[No, I do not subscribe to the Church of the Nonstop Hustle’s teachings](https://medium.com/@mg/no-i-do-not-subscribe-to-the-church-of-the-nonstop-hustle-s-teachings-792ef7a4e549?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(2 min read)</span>  
Evenings spent without work, a relaxing weekend (even if just one day), and time spent away from the office should be seen as a net gain for your brain and be encouraged.

#### **What we shipped this week**  

**<u>Share a reaction and its reports (Improvement)</u>**  
You can now share your reaction and its reports with anyone by sending them a link to the report. You can generate this link from the reports page. Anyone with this link will be able to view the report without logging into DomReactor. However they will only have read-only access to the reports and cannot make any changes.

**<u>Autocompletion of URLs on the new reaction page (Improvement)</u>**  
On the new reaction page, DomReactor will now try to autocomplete your page URLs based on URLs you have already tested against. This will make kicking off those tests even faster. 

Happy Testing,  
Your friends at DomReactor
