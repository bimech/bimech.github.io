I have “liked” more funding news than I can count. And I mean it, as much as one can mean a digital like. It’s a small nod to a pretty monumental accomplishment in any startup’s life. It’s very cool. It’s validation.

Money often defines success and someone giving you a bunch of it to give your idea a shot has got to feel pretty great. I wouldn’t know, because we are bootstrapped. We aren’t just bootstrapped, we’re <i>part-time bootstrapped</i>.

> There isn’t a load of cash or press releases or launch parties. We don’t often grab headlines - we aren’t bus crashes. We’re high blood pressure.

When I was approached to get involved by [Frank](https://twitter.com/_fohara) for creating [Domreactor](https://domreactor.com), our automated cross-browser UI consistency testing platform, there were some things I was immediately sold on. "*This solves a need.*"

Almost every company I know does this manually or mostly manually. It’s time and labor intensive in a field that often has little of either. Companies rightfully spend gobs on UI and UX and they want to guarantee consistency.  What’s the point of that experience if IE9 on windows 2008 jacks it up?

Alternatives were scant. There were a couple of other companies trying this. We felt we could do it better. I asked about his perception of cost, both in terms of time and dollars it will take us to get a usable product off the ground. He believed this was something we could accomplish in a reasonable amount of time without a load of capital, part time. On our own. “Bootstrap it”. He then slid me a copy of [Rework from 37Signals](https://37signals.com/rework/). It’s a great read, full of non-traditional ideas, I recommend checking it out.

Up until that point I did not know a lot about <i>bootstrapping</i>. I had worked a long time with alternative asset managers and I knew all about the “traditional” path. It did seem easy enough.

Keep our day jobs, work on this nights and weekends.

Boom, MVP in no time.

No equity given up.

No risk of losing your day job.

No endless pitching business plans and ideas and groveling for cash and divvying up your shares and dignity.

Early on, this notion was left unchallenged. We eventually brought on a third member, then a fourth.  We worked when we could. I went to tons of events and panels and meetups for startups and entrepreneurs and techies. By far, the majority of the companies presenting and talking were companies that had pitched their ideas fairly early on and had gotten angel or seed capital. They were for the most part much younger than the 30 somethings we were.

I met very few people in the same boat as us - *older and eschewing investment*. I thought, these people had taken the hard road. The stories of humiliating pitches, watching out bad investors, handing over half your company, the constant fundraising, the lawyers. So many lawyers. Why jump through all those hoops when you don’t have to?  There were not many bootstrappers to talk about the unique perils of bootstrapping.

> Shortly thereafter it began to happen. It wasn’t as easy as we had thought. This was actually a pretty tough problem to solve. No wonder only a few companies had tried tackling it.

We went through a lot of code to create a prototype that was wasn’t all that useful in a production environment. Our app kept falling over like a drunk toddler with inner ear balance disorder.

We talked to potential users. We pivoted. Then pivoted again.

> While having that day job afforded a financial sense of security, costs mounted in other ways. Time. Focus. Energy.

If your day job is your startup you can put in those 8-12 hour days, go home and relax, unwind, or focus on other things (though I am sure many opt to not or feel they cannot). But when you’re bootstrapped, it doesn’t matter that you just finished a 70 hour work week, that you’re exhausted, or that you’d really rather have half a pizza, 3 beers and watch battle bots. You need to get to work.

I wasn’t prepared for the mental demand. Typically you can use your nights and weekends, a few of them at least, to refocus and reenergize. We weren’t really afforded that luxury. When you don’t have this downtime, your work, both day and night, suffers.

> As much as time was an issue, the biggest one was pretty constant. **It was life.**

And when you’re in your mid-30s you tend to have a lot of it. We had wives, kids, mortgages, car loans, dependent bartenders. At first it was easy. We were full of confidence, energy and enthusiasm. Friends, significant others and family were behind us. Giving us time and space and we gave ourselves the same.

But as the months rolled on, the work would ebb and flow along with all that energy, confidence and enthusiasm. Patience would wear thin. Not just from others but with ourselves.

Typically you can focus on your career M-F during the day and bucket everything else outside of that. But when those nights are taken up by your <i>bootstrap</i>,  there are only so many nights you can go without quality time with the significant other or kids, only so many dinner times you can skip, household budget concessions to make, only so many instances of asking others to pick up the slack in your home and personal life to accommodate your endeavors.

We had one original member bow out due to the real demands of 2 kids and a new house. When hard decisions on priority need to be made, it becomes easy for others to look at a part time bootstrapped venture as possibly less “serious” an undertaking than a full time gig.  If you’re not fully invested in the startup, how serious could it be? In fact it was easy for me to think that way and lose focus and momentum.

But it never strayed much down the list or from our minds and eventually we regained our focus, cleared a path and pushed to make Domreactor a reality.

It never hurts to have affirmation. [Todd Connor](https://twitter.com/toddconnor), co-founder of [Flank5 Academy](http://t.co/jtzeXUrHdi) and [Bunker Labs](http://t.co/jXwqbHgJe4) gave a speech at [Fund Conference](http://www.fundconference.com/). He spoke about getting to revenue without taking investment. It was the talk I enjoyed the most. Not only because he gave tips on how to get to there, but because of his belief and enthusiasm that there is another way that many people don’t really consider. In the context of a conference meant to mingle startups with capital, this stood out even more. It’s a valuable message and one I never tire of hearing.

> When I do meet other bootstraps that have launched, I always get a little more excited. We should have a handshake or something.

The trials of launching a startup, particularly a bootstrapped one, led to an unexpected outcome. It actually helped me discover where my limits were in terms of a work/life balance. As they bleed into each other so completely in this kind of lifestyle, hard limits were needed.

An expected outcome was that when we finally had our production launch, we took satisfaction in knowing we created something valuable completely on our own and put ourselves in a better position as a young company going forward.

No headlines.

No launch parties.

Just product.
