Happy Monday!! Hope you all had an amazing weekend.

Here is a quick update about some of the improvements we made to [DomReactor](https://domreactor.com) this past week. Also, here are some interesting articles to get your week started. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.  


####**What we are reading this week**

**[The Right Way to Ship Software](http://firstround.com/review/the-right-way-to-ship-software/)** <span class="post-meta">(9 min read)</span>  
In a profession where we carry out decade-spanning holy wars over tab widths and capitalization, it’s no surprise that people get attached to their development and release habits. But if shipping so much software has taught me one thing, it’s to be an agnostic. Different methodologies optimize for different goals, and all of them have downsides.

**[7 Rules for creating gorgeous UI(Part 1)](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda)** <span class="post-meta">(12 min read)</span>  
If you went to art school or consider yourself a UI designer already, you will likely find this guide some combination of a.) boring, b.) wrong, and c.) irritating. But if you are a Developer or UX Designer, this article is for you.

**[7 Rules for creating gorgeous UI(Part 2)](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2-430de537ba96)** <span class="post-meta">(13 min read)</span>  
Follow up to the above mentioned article. We’re talking about rules for designing clean and simple UI without needing to attend art school in order to do so.

**[How to Know What Advice to Take (And What to Ignore)](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/how-to-take-advice)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
It’s easy to get overwhelmed by advice, and just as easy to forget to think for ourselves when smart people tell us what they would do.

**[7 Rejections](https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084)** <span class="post-meta">(2 min read)</span>  
"In 2008 we were raising $150,000 at a $1.5M valuation. Here's the response. Think of this next time you're rejected." - Brian Chesky (CEO, Airbnb)  

**[Slack’s $2.8 Billion Dollar Secret Sauce](https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908)** <span class="post-meta">(7 min read)</span>  
Slack acts like your wise-cracking robot sidekick, instead of the boring enterprise chat tool it would otherwise be.

**[Disruption is better when it's other people’s jobs](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3944-disruption-is-better-when-its-other-peoples-jobs)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
The sooner you stop fighting the present, the sooner you can get to work on figuring out the future.

####**What we shipped this week**  

**<u>Improve the URL Validation (Improvement)</u>**  
We can now work with web URLs with special HTTP Headers or self signed SSL certificates.

**<u>Improve the browsers list view (Improvement)</u>**  
We have improved the browser list on the Account Setting page to be more intuitive. It is a lot more easier to find and add browsers now.

**<u>Fix screenshot rendering on Reports (Bug Fix)</u>**  
We have fixed a bug on the report page where sometimes the screenshot was being rendered after the bounding box for the differences had been loaded. This would cause the bounding boxes to become hidden behind the screenshot.

Happy Testing,  
Your friends at DomReactor
