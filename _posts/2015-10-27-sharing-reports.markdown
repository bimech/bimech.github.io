Let's say you are a developer and you want to quickly share a report for a test you just ran with your designer. Or may be you are a designer and you want to show the effects of a recent change to a developer on your team. 

How would you go about that? 

Up until today, there was no way to access this report without logging into DomReactor. 

Well, not anymore!

From today onwards, you can go to the reports page and generate a shareable link to the report by clicking on the "Share Reaction" button. Just copy this link and send it to anyone who would like to show the report to. 

Anyone with this link will have a read only access to the report and won't be able to make any changes.

Here is a [link to a reaction](https://domreactor.com/chain_reactions/102?share_token=nsPzC7oSC5EjCqdc) that we have shared within our company.

We are thrilled with new feature as it allows us to seamlessly share reports with each other. We hope you find it as useful as we do.

Until next time.

Happy Testing,  
Your friends at DomReactor
