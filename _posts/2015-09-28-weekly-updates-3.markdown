Happy Monday!! Hope you all had an amazing weekend.

Here is a quick update about some of the improvements we made to [DomReactor](https://domreactor.com) this past week. Also, here are some interesting articles to get your week started. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.  


####**What we are reading this week**

**[Put an end to feature creep](http://www.productstrategymeanssayingno.com/?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
This interactive post by the smart folks at [Intercom](https://intercom.io?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates) talks about how to say to no to new features and instead work on improving your current application. 

**[Strategic Apathy](http://joshkaufman.net/strategic-apathy?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
By deploying strategic apathy when appropriate, you’re not really giving anything up: you’re just making it more difficult for the world to distract you with shiny, worthless baubles.

**[Do fewer things well](http://time.com/3975253/uber-engineering-director-productivity/)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
Having a productive day starts off by generally understanding the important goals you are working towards and blockers that will get in your way. This doesn’t start on the particular day but actually days, weeks, and months beforehand by doing a few things well.

**[Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(2 min read)</span>  
Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.

**[When do fans get hooked on TV shows ](http://www.fastcompany.com/3051434/a-new-netflix-study-reveals-when-viewers-get-hooked-on-their-tv-shows?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
A new study reveals when viewers get "hooked" on their TV shows, which episodes lead to binge-watching? Netflix examines "when fandom began" for 25 different series.  

**[The one secret thing that all successful people do](https://medium.com/@jay_zo/the-one-secret-thing-all-successful-people-do-872c375b552f)** <span class="post-meta">(1 min read)</span>  
Summarizing this would be a disservice to our readers.

**[Cargo Culting](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3947-cargo-culting?utm_source=DomReactor+Weekly+Updates)** <span class="post-meta">(5 min read)</span>  
As we are designing something, are we just cargo culting an experience we take for granted somewhere else? Do we understand the actual job someone wants to do with the thing we are designing? Are we designing to be consistent with a pattern our users expect at the expense of figuring out how to help them kick more ass?

####**What we shipped this week**  

**<u>Show all tests on the dashboard (Improvement)</u>**  
We made an assumption early on that people don't want to share the tests that they are running with other people in the organization. And boy were we wrong. So we fixed that. Now, on your dashboard, you can actually see all the tests that have been run by your team members.

**<u>Improvements to the dashboard UI (Improvement)</u>**  
We have made some tweaks to the dashboard screen so that the information displayed about each test is more relevant and intuitive. We have added specific columns to display the baseline and comparison browsers along with the total number of differences that were found during the test.

Happy Testing,  
Your friends at DomReactor
