Last week I went to an event hosted by [General Assembly Chicago](https://generalassemb.ly/chicago) on the Internet of things(IoT). The panel opined on a range of topics covering wearables, data analysis, what to do with said data, privacy, Opt in networks vs Opt Out networks (interesting), and possible federal regulations. But the 2 things that stuck out to me were the social cost of connectivity on cultures (really interesting and for sure a topic for another day) but also managing the consistency of user experience across all those platforms. [Coleman Collins](https://twitter.com/COLEMANICEWATER) at [Thoughtworks](https://twitter.com/thoughtworks) brought this up. It was an aside at the start of the panel, but it got me thinking - How big is this problem today, and how big will it be in the future?  

My immediate responses were: <i>not too big and massive</i>. IoT has yet to completely pervade our lives. While we have cars, watches and fridges that remind us to slow down, walk more and stop buying hot pockets: this isn't commonplace yet. We have yet to have a google toilet that reads your emails, texts and also tells you to stop eating hot pockets. I also think a large segment of the population will actively resist this movement and decide laptops and smartphones are as connected as they want to be. That makes a product like [Domreactor](https://domreactor.com) pretty relevant and useful today and for the foreseeable future.  

> In automating UI consistency testing of web sites and apps over desktops and mobile, we cover the most important platforms. And UI is still one of the most important mediums a company can express a user experience and its brand.  

But as devices are connected and more and more platforms are brought on, handling the consistency of that experience, as Colemen pointed out, will become very difficult.  How do you maintain that same experience for your brand across laptops, tablets, phones, glasses and toilets? We already have a fairly broken and disjointed state when it comes to mobile testing alone.  

This felt like an overwhelming problem. But I am kind of an idiot so I felt it best to ask Coleman his thoughts. Thankfully he said it's exactly this problem that keeps him up at night. It's a big issue. I felt better. I may not be an idiot (tbd).  Next question, how do we tackle it?  "I don't know". He said automation, akin to what we are doing with Domreactor, will certainly play a part, as well as understanding there is an allowable amount of acceptable deviation a user can tolerate without eroding the experience and figuring out what that is.  My gut feeling is that it will take a confluence of automation, end user input, and design to overcome this consistency of experience in an IoT world.  

I really liked his “I Don’t Know” answer. First of all it meant I didn’t miss out on any big news I should probably be tuned into. But mostly because this means there is opportunity there. At Binary Mechanics, we are betting on the technologies of machine learning and image analysis (like computer vision) will continue to grow at a pace on par with that of the IoT. When we let our minds wander towards what we can provide in the long term, it’s not too hard to think of Domreactor as a first step in a new, exciting and comprehensive way to test consistency across multiple platforms of all kinds.  

Stay posted.
