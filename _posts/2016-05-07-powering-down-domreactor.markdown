The time has come to power down the reactor. We built DOMReactor with the ambitious goal of reliably detecting visual differences across browsers, and we worked hard towards that goal up until the end. Visual consistency testing remains a difficult problem to solve, but we are proud of the progress we made and the knowledge we have accumulated along the way.

Binary Mechanics, the team behind DOMReactor, will continue working together to make it easier to test software, and we look forward to tackling the problem of visual consistency testing from new angles. We would like to thank everyone for using our software, and we look forward to showing you something new in the future.

Cheers,

Team BiMech
